Hi, I’m **Faysal**. I will handle all the backend development for you, including managing authentication, vendor listing, product posting, and other backend-related functionalities. Your role is to focus on cleaning up and structuring the frontend code for easier integration. 

Here is the link to the documentation that outlines the structure and design of the project:
