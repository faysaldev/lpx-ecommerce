# Project README

Hey Khalid,  

As we discussed, this file will serve as a quick way for us to stay aligned on the project.  
Please remember to keep all official communication within the platform as required.  
This README will only stay live for a short time (~30 minutes) to exchange updates before being replaced with the official project documentation again.  

If you need anything urgent, just leave me a direct message here in the platform.  
Let’s keep everything professional and normal in the company chat as well.
